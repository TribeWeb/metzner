The pneumatic cutting mechanism is capable of up to 140 cuts per minute and the twin feed belts gently clamping the material and feeding it through the machine in a way that gives highly repeatable results.

The infeed of the Variocut allows for cutting of materials up to 95mm wide and 30mmhigh. Also with itâ€™s extremely simple operation, once the belt feed has been lowered,the material is clamped automatically. The pressure, provided by a pneumatic system, prevents any slippage so that the operator does not have anything to adjust. Tools changing is equally easy, the tools are inserted and removed by hand, no other adjustment is necessary.
