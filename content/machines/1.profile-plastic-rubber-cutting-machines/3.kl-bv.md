The KL-BV was developed for cutting stretchy or very soft materials such as silicone. Widely used in the medical industry, it can cut highly elastic materials precisely and to a very accurate length.

Fitted with an extremely thin blade, the KL-BV allows for precise cuts and little ‘crushing’ which can lead to poor cut quality. These blades are quick to replace and very low cost too.

The Metzner KL-BV medical tube cutting also has speed control. The feed speed can be reduced to improve length accuracy for smaller tubes of 30 mm length, for example. It is available with punch, shear and draw cutting modules.

For specific applications the Metzner KL-BV is also available in a stainless-steel version. A version for clean rooms is also an option. The KL-BV medical tube cutting machine can also be supplied with electric drive instead of compressed air.
