title: Prefeeders
description: Work with dereelers to maintain a tension-free loop for precise,
  repeatable cutting.
---

Used in conjunction with dereelers, to pull material off reels, spools or coils. This maintains a tension free loop before the cutting machine, ensuring a precise and repeatable cut length.

### Why would I need a prefeeder?

- To feed elastic or delicate cables and tubes into cutting or stripping machines.
- To assist high-speed production lines where consistent, slip-free feeding is critical.
- To automate systems, where maintaining tension-free material flow improves cut quality.

### PF2000 Prefeeder

The PF200 prefeeder is an electrically driven unit designed to pull cables, tubes, or profiles from passive reels or spools with no slip or tension. It's drive speed adapts automatically using a dancing arm or Metzner’s loop control system, ensuring smooth synchronization with downstream machines like cutters or printers.

This modular system comprises four base units and offers five different speed-control options, allowing you to tailor the setup precisely to your process. You can choose either an electrical 3 Phase drive for cost efficiency, or a servo drive for tighter synchronization.

### Key Benefits

- Delivers tension-free material feeding from passive reels.
- Automatically adjusts feed speed to match downstream processing.
- Flexible drive options: high-performance servo or economical three‑phase.
- Modular design allows for four base units and five controllers for a custom build.
- Compatible with most cut, strip, or marking systems, including non‑Metzner machines.
