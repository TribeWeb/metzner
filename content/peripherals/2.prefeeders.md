title: Prefeeders
description: Works with dereelers to maintain a tension-free loop for precise,
  repeatable cutting.
---

Used in conjunction with dereelers, to pull material off reels, spools or coils. This maintains a tension free loop before the cutting machine ensuring a precise and repeatable cut length.

The PF200 prefeeder is an electrically driven unit designed to pull cables, tubes, or profiles from passive reels or spools with no slip and no tension. Metzner Maschinenbau+1 Its drive speed adapts automatically using a dancing arm or Metzner’s loop control system, ensuring smooth synchronization with downstream machines like cutters or printers. Metzner Maschinenbau+1

This modular system comprises four base units and offers five different speed-control options, allowing you to tailor the setup precisely to your process. Metzner Maschinenbau You can choose either a three‑phase drive for cost efficiency, or a servo drive for tighter synchronization. Metzner Maschinenbau

### Key Benefits

- Delivers tension-free material feeding from passive reels. Metzner Maschinenbau+1
- Automatically adjusts feed speed to match downstream processing. Metzner Maschinenbau
- Flexible drive options: high-performance servo or economical three‑phase. Metzner Maschinenbau
- Modular design — four base units × five controllers for a custom build. Metzner Maschinenbau
- Compatible with most cut, strip, or marking systems, including non‑Metzner machines. Metzner Maschinenbau

### Why would I need a prefeeder?

- To feed elastic or delicate cables and tubes into cutting or stripping machines.
- Assist high-speed production lines where consistent, slip-free feeding is critical.
- Automate systems, where maintaining tension-free material flow improves cut quality.
