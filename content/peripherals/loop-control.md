Loop Controls are digital controllers, used to ensure a tension free entry loop before product enters the cutting machine. By controlling the feed rate of a prefeeder, or in some cases the cutting machine, detectors ensure the product is fed into the machine with a slack, tension free, loop.

Metzner offers loop control systems that dynamically monitor loop length to stabilise material feed in real time. Metzner Maschinenbau+1 These systems adjust the speed of either the cutting machine or the prefeeder, depending on loop tension, to avoid stretching or tearing of elastic materials.

Models include a 3‑point control and a 10‑point control, giving you options for different precision and control demands. The loop control integrates seamlessly with the PF200 prefeeder family, allowing you to build a perfectly tuned feed system.

### Key Benefits

- Real-time regulation of material feed to maintain tension-free operation.
- Multiple sensor points (3-point or 10-point) for high-resolution control.
- Protects delicate or elastic materials from damage caused by sudden speed changes or tension.
- Compatible with Metzner prefeeders, taking full advantage of modular flexibility.
- Supports consistent cut length by adapting to real-time material loop dynamics.

### When would I need a Loop Control?

- They assist with high-precision cutting lines that require exact length control.
- When processing elastic, soft or delicate materials. Higher tension can distort the product.
- Within automated setups where looping occurs and needs to be managed without interruption.
- Within lines using prefeeders or take-off units that benefit from active feedback-based speed control.
