Loop Controls are digital controllers, that control the feed rate of material into the cutting machine. This is achieved by ensuring a tension free loop before entry into the cutting machine. They acheive this by controlling the feed rate of a prefeeder, with detectors that ensure the product is fed into the machine with a slack, tension free, loop.

Metzner offers loop control systems that dynamically monitor loop length to stabilise material feed in real time. These systems adjust the speed of either the cutting machine or the prefeeder, depending on loop tension. This avoids stretching or tearing of elastic materials.

Models include a 3‑point control and a 10‑point control, giving you options for different precision and control demands. The loop control integrates seamlessly with the PF200 prefeeder, allowing you to fine tune material entry into the cutting machine.

### When would I need a Loop Control?

- When processing elastic, soft or delicate materials. Higher tension can distort the product.
- Within lines using prefeeders or take-off units that benefit from active feedback-based speed control.
- When operating high-precision cutting lines that require consistent, exact length control.

### Key Benefits

- Real-time regulation of material feed to maintain tension-free operation.
- Multiple sensor points (3-point or 10-point) for high-resolution control.
- Protects delicate or elastic materials from damage caused by sudden speed changes or tension.
- Compatible with Metzner prefeeders, taking full advantage of modular flexibility.
- Supports consistent cut length by adapting to real-time material loop dynamics.
