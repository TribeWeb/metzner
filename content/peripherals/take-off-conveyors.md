title: Take Off Conveyors
description: A  take-off conveyor removes finished products, enabling a smooth
  workflow and continuous cutting.
---

A take-off conveyor is designed to remove cut material from the cutting machine, allowing the next section to be processed without interruption. This ensures continuous, smooth operation, and with Metzner’s MA series, jam-free collection.

### When would I need a take-off conveyor?

- For long, thin, or flexible cables that require stable guidance after cut.
- You require continuous operation where cutting lines must run without interruption.
- When you have a production line that needs neat batch separation and collection.
- To integrate cutting with stripping or marking machines for automated handling.
- To assist high-volume cable or wire production that requires jam-free stacking.

### MA Stackers

Metzner MA stackers use a driven transport belt to stack cables straight and without jams. Each unit features a batch tray and a separate collection tray so production continues automatically while the previous batch is removed - preventing batch mixing and reducing operator intervention.

Available as standalone units but typically integrated with Metzner cutting and stripping machines, the MA series increases line autonomy and throughput for cable production lines. Models are compatible with all Metzner cutters, with multiple models designed for a wide range of wire diameters and extrusion types. Select from:

- **MA 2000** — for lengths to 2 m.
- **MA 4000** — for lengths to 4 m.
- **MA 6000** — for lengths to 6 m.
