A take-off conveyor is designed to to take the cut product away from the machine. This allows for the next part to be cut easily, help with continous and smooth operation and with the MA series provide jam-free collection.

Metzner MA stackers use a driven transport belt to stack cables straight and without jams. Each unit features a batch tray and a separate collection tray so production continues automatically while the previous batch is removed - preventing batch mixing and reducing operator intervention.

Available as standalone units but typically integrated with Metzner cutting and stripping machines, the MA series increases line autonomy and throughput for cable production lines. Models are compatible with all Metzner cutters, with multiple models designed for a wide range of wire diameters and extrusion types. Select from:

- **MA 2000** — for lengths to 2 m.
- **MA 4000** — for lengths to 4 m.
- **MA 6000** — for lengths to 6 m.
