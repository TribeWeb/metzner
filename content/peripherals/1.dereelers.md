### Passive dereelers

A passive dereeler lets material unwind smoothly under its own weight. For smaller or lighter reels, passive dereelers are the lowest cost method of ensuring cutting machines are fed at a steady rate. They are often used in conjunction with a [prefeeder](/peripherals/prefeeders).

### Active dereelers

Motor-driven dereelers feed material independently, preventing the cutting machine from pulling directly from the reel. This prevents the material from slipping or being stretched and distorted. This ensures a consistent and accurate cutting length. They are often used with a loop control.

### Why would I need a dereeler?

- To feed elastic or delicate tubes or materials into cutting or stripping machines.
- Assist in processing heavy reels, that require controlled tension.
- Ensure high-speed production lines where consistent, slip-free feeding is critical.
- Automate systems, where maintaining tension-free material flow can improve cut quality.
