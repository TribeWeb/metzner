### Passive dereelers

A passive dereeler lets material unwind smoothly under its own weight. For smaller or lighter reels, passive dereelers are the lowest cost method of ensuring cutting machines are fed at an optimum rate. They are often used in conjunction with a [prefeeder](/peripherals/prefeeders).

### Active dereelers

Motor-driven dereelers feed material independently, preventing the cutting machine from pulling directly from the reel. This prevents the material from being stretched, distorted or slipping.

### Why would I need a dereeler?

- To feed elastic or delicate cables and tubes into cutting or stripping machines.
- Assist in processing heavy reels, that require controlled tension.
- Ensure high-speed production lines where consistent, slip-free feeding is critical.
- Automate systems, where maintaining tension-free material flow can improve cut quality.
