### Passive dereelers

For smaller or lighter reels, passive dereelers are our lowest cost method of ensuring cutting machines are fed at an optimum rate. They are often used in conjunction with a prefeeder.

### Active dereelers

Our motor driven dereelers ensure that materials are fed so that the cutting machine does not pull from the reel. This prevents the material from being stretched, distorted or slipping ensuring optimum cutting precision.
