### Passive dereelers

For smaller or lighter reels, passive dereelers are our lowest cost method of ensuring cutting machines are fed at an optimum rate. They are often used in conjunction with a [prefeeder](/peripherals/prefeeders).

### Active dereelers

Our motor driven dereelers ensure that materials are fed so that the cutting machine does not pull from the reel. This prevents the material from being stretched, distorted or slipping ensuring optimum cutting precision.

### Why would I need a dereeler?

- To feed elastic or delicate cables and tubes into cutting or stripping machines.
- Assit in processing heavy reels, that require controlled tension.
- Ensure high-speed production lines where consistent, slip-free feeding is critical.
- Automate systems, where maintaining tension-free material flow improves cut quality.
