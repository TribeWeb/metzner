When product requires some form of marking or labelling, Metzner cutting machines integrate fully to numerous print options. With functionality to mark your product with your company name, part numbers or even depth locators on tubes, printers can offer a finished product in one process. Marking can be either ink based or laser etched, based on your specific needs.

A Metzner printer module integrates seamlessly with your cutting or strip‑to-length machine, allowing automated marking of cables, wires, tubes, or plastic/rubber profiles. Choose from a range of printing technologies — ink-jet, thermal transfer, hot stamp, or laser — depending on your material.

System integration supports “on-the-fly” marking, so there’s no need to stop production for printing. Whether you need to mark company logos, part numbers, batch codes or assembly instructions, our printers deliver durable, high-contrast results.

### Why would I use a printer?

- Permanent identification of cables, wires or tubes (part numbers, batch details, assembly codes)
- Achieve safety and compliance requirements
- Branding and logo marking on rubber or plastic extrusions
- Traceability marking (e.g. barcodes) for quality control or regulatory compliance
- Instructional or positional marking for downstream assembly or installation
