Printer integration supports “on-the-fly” marking, so production continues without interruption. Whether you need to mark logos, numbers, codes or instructions, our printers deliver durable, high-contrast results.

By permanent marking with either ink based or laser etching, printers can offer a finished product in one process.

### Why do I need a printer?

- Permanent identification of tubes, extrusions and cut materials (part numbers, batch details, assembly codes, depth locators and company name)
- Achieve safety and compliance requirements
- Branding and logo marking on rubber or plastic extrusions
- Traceability marking (e.g. barcodes) for quality control or regulatory compliance
- Instructional or positional marking for downstream assembly or installation
