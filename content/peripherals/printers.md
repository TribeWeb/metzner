When product requires some form of marking or labelling, Metzner cutting machines integrate with numerous print options. With functionality to mark your product with your company name, part numbers or depth locators, printers can offer a finished product in one process. Marking can be either ink based or laser etched, based on your specific needs.

System integration supports “on-the-fly” marking, so production continues without interruption. Whether you need to mark logos, numbers, codes or instructions, our printers deliver durable, high-contrast results.

### Why would I use a printer?

- Permanent identification of cables, wires or tubes (part numbers, batch details, assembly codes)
- Achieve safety and compliance requirements
- Branding and logo marking on rubber or plastic extrusions
- Traceability marking (e.g. barcodes) for quality control or regulatory compliance
- Instructional or positional marking for downstream assembly or installation
