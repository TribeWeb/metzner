From simple tubes to complex sealing profiles, whether your extrusions are reinforced or not, our wide selection of cutting machines allows us to meet a vast majority of cutting requirements.

Whilst repeatability and accuracy is key, we appreciate that every cutting project is different. That's why we can offer you single machines or specify a full production suite from our range of fully compatible peripherals. From very specific cutting projects, to machines designed for multiple use cases, see our range below based on the type of product you are cutting, or speak to one of our engineers for more information.
