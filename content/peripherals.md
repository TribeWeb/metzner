## Our Peripherals Range

Peripherals integrate with Metzner cutting systems to add features and capabilities. From streamlining material handling, improving accuracy and adding automation, peripherals are used to complete your Metzner solution.

### Dereelers — Passive & Active

Dereelers will take material from a reel, into your Metzner cutting machine. Passive dereelers support light reels pasively, without any power. Active (motorised) dereelers pull material to prevent the cutter from drawing directly from the reel. Dereelers are useful for:

- Small or lightweight spools (passive)
- Heavy or high-tension reels (active)
- Preventing slip, stretch or spool distortion

### Prefeeders

Prefeeders are electrically driven units that pull material from reels or spools without tension, with selectable drive options for different speeds and pull forces. They are added to systems as they:

- Provide slip-free feeding from passive reels
- Assist High-speed lines requiring consistent supply
- Can be required for sensitive or elastic materials that must not stretch

### Loop Controls

Loops Controls offer real-time loop monitoring and speed regulation to keep a slack, tension-free loop ahead of the cutter. Used with:

- Materials prone to distortion under tension
- Automated lines that require active feedback control
- Precision length controllers on high-accuracy lines

### Printers & Marking Modules

Ink-jet, thermal-transfer, hot-stamp or laser options for inline marking of logos, part numbers, barcodes and assembly marks. Used for:

- On-the-fly identification without stopping the line
- Traceability (batch codes, barcodes)
- Branding or assembly position marking

### Take-off Conveyors & MA Stackers

Take-off conveyors are driven belt conveyors and stackers, offering jam-free collection and stable guidance of cut parts. Applications include:

- Continuous, unattended production lines
- Long, thin or flexible cables that need guided handling
- When batch separation is required
