## Our Peripherals Range

Metzner peripherals integrate with our cutting systems to streamline material handling, improve accuracy and add functional capability — from tension-free feeding to automated marking and jam-free collection.

### Dereelers — Passive & Active

Passive dereelers cost-effectively support light reels; active (motorised) dereelers pull material to prevent the cutter from drawing directly from the reel. Applications:

- Small or lightweight spools (passive)
- Heavy or high-tension reels (active)
- Preventing slip, stretch or spool distortion

### Prefeeders

Electrically driven units that pull material from reels or spools without tension, with selectable drive options for different speeds and pull forces.

- Slip-free feeding from passive reels
- High-speed lines requiring consistent supply
- Sensitive or elastic materials that must not stretch

### Loop Controls

Real-time loop monitoring and speed regulation to keep a slack, tension-free loop ahead of the cutter. Applications:

- Precision length control on high-accuracy lines
- Materials prone to distortion under tension
- Automated lines that require active feedback control

### Printers & Marking Modules

Ink-jet, thermal-transfer, hot-stamp or laser options for inline marking of logos, part numbers, barcodes and assembly marks. Applications:

- On-the-fly identification without stopping the line
- Traceability (batch codes, barcodes)
- Branding or assembly position marking

### Take-off Conveyors & MA Stackers

Driven belt conveyors and stackers for jam-free collection, dual-tray batch handling and stable guidance of cut parts. Applications:

- Continuous, unattended production
- Neat batch separation and collection
- Long, thin or flexible cables that need guided handling
