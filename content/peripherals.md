Peripherals integrate with Metzner cutting systems to add features and capabilities. From streamlining material handling, improving accuracy and adding automation, peripherals are used to complete your Metzner solution.

### Why Do I need Peripherals?

- **Extra Features** - Add printing to your system, to provide a finished product within a single process.
- **Increased Automation** - By adding take off conveyors or pre-feed solutions, you can reduce operator intervention and operator time cost.
- **Decrease Wasted Material** - By supporting delicate materials and reducing slippage, dereelers and prefeeders provide reductions in wastage costs.

### Metzner Approved Peripherals

Metzner approves peripherals for use with their cutting machines. To allow you to build larger automated systems, Metzner integrated solutions offer advanced features in a simple ordering process. Peripherals are suggested based upon your individual requirements, so you can rely on complete compatibility and trouble-free integration.

Where solutions were not readily-available, Metzner offers their own options. From Take-Off Conveyors and stackers to the PF2000 range of prefeeders, Metzner offers further functionality with their own designs.

### Available Peripheral Ranges

- **Dereelers** - Controlled unwinding for consistent, tension-free feed into your cutting system.
- **Pre-Feeders** - Accurately advance material into the cutting machine for stable feed and improved cycle consistency.
- **Loop Control** - Maintain a controlled buffer between feed and cutter to decouple line speeds, prevent tension or overruns, and keep cutting continuous.
- **Printers** - Integrate material marking and printing directly inline, for automated identification without stopping production.
- **Take‑Off Conveyors** - Automatically remove cut material from the machine to keep production flowing with uninterrupted operation.
