## Our Peripherals Range

Peripherals integrate with Metzner cutting systems to add further functionality and capabilities. From streamlining material handling, improving accuracy and adding further capabilities, peripherals are used to complete your

### Dereelers — Passive & Active

Passive dereelers support light reels pasively, without any power. Active (motorised) dereelers pull material to prevent the cutter from drawing directly from the reel. Dereelers are useful for:

- Small or lightweight spools (passive)
- Heavy or high-tension reels (active)
- Preventing slip, stretch or spool distortion

### Prefeeders

Electrically driven units that pull material from reels or spools without tension, with selectable drive options for different speeds and pull forces.

- Provides slip-free feeding from passive reels
- Assists High-speed lines requiring consistent supply
- Required for sensitive or elastic materials that must not stretch

### Loop Controls

Real-time loop monitoring and speed regulation to keep a slack, tension-free loop ahead of the cutter. Used with:

- Precision length control on high-accuracy lines
- Materials prone to distortion under tension
- Automated lines that require active feedback control

### Printers & Marking Modules

Ink-jet, thermal-transfer, hot-stamp or laser options for inline marking of logos, part numbers, barcodes and assembly marks. Useful with:

- On-the-fly identification without stopping the line
- Traceability (batch codes, barcodes)
- Branding or assembly position marking

### Take-off Conveyors & MA Stackers

Driven belt conveyors and stackers for jam-free collection and stable guidance of cut parts. Applications include:

- Continuous, unattended production lines
- Long, thin or flexible cables that need guided handling
- When batch separation is required
