## Pipe CS

The ST-OB is a very well established and extremely robust machine which is versatile in its ability to cut tubes, textiles and extruded profiles to length with high accuracy. Used in a variety of industries from automotive door seals to hoses in the medical industry.

The machine can be supplied with three interchangeable cutting mechanisms for die cut (kiss cut), tube cut or shear cut. These cutting heads make the ST0OB a very versatile machine with multiple applications.

Material is pulled into the machine via two feed belts (top and bottom) and these are tensioned by hand to give a good grip without excessive pressure. The pneumatic cylinder, which operated the cutting blade, is specially developed for Metzner, it gives high power for cutting but also vents quickly for a quick cutting speed.
